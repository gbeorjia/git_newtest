Hello World,
So, once we edit our document here, the next step is to go to our terminal,
and input "git status"
This will make us aware of any changes that were made to these files,
Afterward, we input "git add hello_world"

Next, the file will show as changed and this is when we input:
git commit -m "EDIT hello_world.txt"
